<h1 class="title">There is no such thing as OOP!</h1>
<p>
Let me start with what I want to say, OOP is just a bag of misfounded tricks
that reflects a great deal of confusion about the nature of programming. It
should be forgotten by now because it is confusing and it encourages all
sorts of messy programs. In fact, FP is not different. There are no such
things man, there is only programming!
</p>

<p>
Let's go back to computation. There are two popular ways of computing things.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>One that focuses on mutating immediate values at each step like an</li>
</ol>
<p>
abacus, which is founded on Turing machines and we can think at a higher
level so that we can use Random Access Machine instead. You can call this
one imperative computation or abacus computation, if you want to.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>This one focuses on computation by recursive function application and</li>
</ol>
<p>
there lies lambda calculus at its basis. You can call this one functional
computation, again if you want to.
</p>

<div class="remark">
<p>
There are other models of computation but let's stick with these two for
now. 
</p>

</div>

<p>
As you can see, being functional or imperative is not about programming.
It's about computation. Of course, your chosen model of computation affects
how you program. For that, let's also take a look at what is programming. 
<b>Programming</b> is to structure computations in a way that solves a particular
problem. If your model of computation is based on lambda calculus, you
will be doing a lot of recursion as in Haskell or Lisp. If your model of
computation is RAM, than you we'll be doing a lot of loops as in C++. So,
model of computation affects your programming indeed. But it is the structuring
part that is the meat of programming and structuring techniques are universal
accross models of computation. 
</p>

<p>
Where does OOP fall then? Well, its place is actually rather miserable. 
Say, OOP is about things like information hiding, encapsulation, weak
coupling, strong cohesion, DRY, SOLID etc. OOP crowd loves giving things
names that are not mathematical because somehow mathematics is not
welcoming to the layman and apparently there is never any need to learn
the actual mathematics behind. Why anoyone invented any math in the fist
place? Who needed vector spaces? You could call it "collection of straight
things with a common starting point" and abbreviate it as COSTWACSP. A lot
better than vector spaces, right?
</p>

<p>
OOP is about programming, nothing wrong there, Its concern for things like
cohesion, SOLID etc. shows that it is about structuring programs. But,
it is a rather ad-hoc way of structuring programs and as with everything
of this sort, in introduces more confusion than it clears up. 
</p>

<p>
First of all, OOP makes it amazingly confusing to think about types. 
You have classes, public structs, unions, abstract base protected interface inheritances&#x2026; 
Wow, so much bullshit. They introduced all this nonsense so that they
can achieve information hiding and encapsulation while having inheritance
but in reality, it fails. Think about it, only reason we want information
hiding and encapsulation is so that we can achieve code reuse. We want
to write code, luckily, once and if we want to extend the program in 
the future, we will change only one place. You don't need to pollute
your types with all this nonsense to achieve this! If you have a proper
module system, you are just fine. Than you can go back to thinking 
about types in terms of algebraic entities. You can do product and sum
types, you can have that amazingly good thing we call pattern matching.
Think about it, C++ have sum types, right? <b>std::variant</b>? Well, 
visitors are useless and pain in the ass.
</p>

<p>
And don't get me started on inheritance&#x2026; No one uses it anymore except
some interface inheritence and that is just poor type classes. Well, but
interfaces may have data&#x2026; Well, they shouldn't. It is just another global
variable hidden in the name of information hiding and it just calls for
more bad programming practices. C++ concepts will be hopefully better in
that regard. But the real thing is, even Java and C++ is not OOP anymore.
Most of the uses of inheritance is, as I said, interface inheritance and
it is just used together with generics and templates to have parametric 
polymorphism. OOP's confusion about types just makes everything harder.
You can't have proper parametric polymorphism, you need extra hacks. You
can't have algebraic data types because again, you need hacks&#x2026; OOP is
just a big, not-really-ok hack. 
</p>

<p>
By the way, there is a name for structuring your code in the best possible
way, it is called generic programming. Generic programming is just
programming actually, there should not have been a need to give a new name but 
OOP confused so many things that we had to follow this path. Generic
programming means striving for mathematical level of generality and clarity
while devising abstractions and that should have been the norm. How to
achieve this level of clarity while also having code reuse was , and
still is, a hard question but we are making progress. Stop that OOP confusion.
Forget everything about it, SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, Design patterns&#x2026; 
</p>

<p>
By the way, most of functional programming is confusion as well. Functional
programming is not about pure functions, is not about higher order 
functions, is not about Monads, Functors, Applicatives. It is only about
one thing; programming with recursive structures. Let's look at following
code.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-cpp"><span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">template</span> &lt;<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">typename</span> <span style="color: #b58900;">T</span>&gt;
<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">struct</span> <span style="color: #b58900;">plus</span> {
    T <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">operator</span>(<span style="color: #b58900;">T</span> <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">const</span>&amp; <span style="color: #268bd2;">e1</span>, <span style="color: #b58900;">T</span> <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">const</span>&amp; <span style="color: #268bd2;">e2</span>){
        <span style="color: #586e75;">// </span><span style="color: #586e75;">Imagine the most imperative way of</span>
        <span style="color: #586e75;">// </span><span style="color: #586e75;">adding two things here</span>
    }
};

<span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">chops</span>::fold(plus{}, <span style="color: #b58900;">some_monoid</span>&lt;<span style="color: #b58900;">T</span>&gt;)... <span style="color: #586e75;">//</span><span style="color: #586e75;">whatever</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
As you can see, I can pass functions as first class objects in very old
C++ and I can still use all my imperative thinking. Higher-order functions
let's you abstract operations and this is just another theme in generic
programming. You have structures and mappings between them and if you
want to write generic code, you need to talk about operations themselves.
Pure functions are also not about FP, the above addition function might
be perfectly pure. Monads, Functors etc. are all generic ways of composing
code while managing side-effects. Monads, Functors and Applicatives are
really not about FP, they are about generic programming just like type 
classes are. So they are about programming which in turn means they are
about mathematics. 
</p>

<p>
You see, all of the popular languages are evolving away from OOP, so what
is the problem? First of all, due to backward compatibility, OOP left a
nasty scar. I get mad the moment I start to think about type constructors
in an OOP langauge. No OOP language has proper pattern matching due to
this reason. We really need a clean slate but we can't have it because we
need to write real-world code! So sad. Rust seems to be doing fine on
this regard. Hope it gets some adoption, then I will learn it. Another 
thing that bothers me is that people think languages are evolving towards
functional, away from OOP. Nope, FP is just programming with recursive 
structures and most of the things you see under the name of FP is just
generic programming, which is just programming. Of course, FP circles
should take some pride. They did not give into bullshit like OOP crowd.
This is why they contributed a lot to the generic programming but C++
community did as much. Still, C++ is brain-dead from all those OOP
scars. 
</p>

<p>
I hope OOP will be forgotten. OOP is the not-so-new goto. We all know this. In 
fact, this post is useless. Everyone knows all of it. Yeah, this is
for those new programmers who are forced to learn OOP. Just don't!
