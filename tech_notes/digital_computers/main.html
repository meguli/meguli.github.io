<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
What do we mean by programming? You might say it is about coding up algorithms
to solve problems. Then, what is an algorithm? Informally, an algorithm is a
series of commands, a recipe that explains how to do something. At this point,
let's give an example algorithm so that everything is concrete. This algorithm
is due to Euclid, great mathematician of Ancient Greek. It describes a process
to find greatest common divisor, GCD from now on, of two <i>natural numbers</i>. First,
let's talk a little bit about GCDs.
</p>

<p>
Suppose we have two numbers, \(a\) and \(b\). We know \(GCD\) of any number and \(0\)
is that number because everything divides \(0\). So if \(a\) or \(b\) is \(0\), we know
the answer. We also  know if \(a = b\), \(GCD(a, b) = GCD(a,a) = a\). If they are
not equal, one is bigger than the other. Say \(a\) is bigger. Write \(a\) in
quotient-remainder form. \[a = b.q + r\] Here is the key idea. Remainder \(r\)
is smaller than \(b\) and \[GCD(a,b) = GCD(b,r)\]
</p>

<p>
Let's reason more about this. Say \(GCD\) of \(a\) and \(b\) is \(k\). Then \(k\) also
divides \(b.q\). So I can write \(a\) as \(k.d1\) for some number \(d1\) and I can
write \(b.q\) as \(k.d2\) for some number \(d2\). Observe that 
\[a - b.q = k(d1 - d2) = r\] and \(k\) divides \(r\) as well. This is the reason
we can say \[GCD(a,b) = GCD(b,r)\] Now we'll describe the algorithm.
</p>

<pre class="example">
1. If a = b, answer is a. Stop!
2. If not, check if a &lt; b. If so swap a and b.
|Notice that at this step, we have a &gt; b|
3. If b = 0, answer is a. Stop!
4. If not, Find the remainder of a/b, call this r.
5. Update a to be b and b to be r.
6. Go back to 1.
</pre>

<p>
Here is an example run of the algortihm where we find \(GCD(60, 18)\).
</p>

<pre class="example">
1.1 60 is not equal to 18, go to next step.
1.2 We check if 60 &lt; 18. No it is not. So we skip the sawp and go to 3.
1.3 b is not 0 so we don't stop. We move to 4.
1.4 Remainder is 6.
1.5 a is now 18 and b is now 6.
1.6 Go back to 1.

2.1 18 is not equal to 6, go to next step.
2.2 We check if 60 &lt; 18. No it is not. So we skip the swap and go to 3.
2.3 b is not 0 so we don't stop. We move to 4.
2.4 Remainder is 0.
2.5 a is now 6 and b is now 0.
2.6 Go back to 1.

3.1 6 is not equal to 0, go to next step.
3.2 We check if 6 &lt; 0. No it is not. So we skip the swap and go to 3.
3.3 b is 0. The answer is 6.

We stop! GCD(60, 18) = 6.
</pre>

<div class="remark">
<p>
In reality, you might not implement the algorithm as described here. I
tried to made every step explicit so that we can understand the process.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Notice how we are decreasing the compared numbers at each step so that
this process bound to reach the end case where one of \(a\) or \(b\) is \(0\).
This is what we mean by an algorithm is finite, it stops with the correct
result after some steps. So, they are like cooking recipes!
</p>

<p>
In fact, programming and cooking are rather similar. First, just like recipes,
we want our algorithms to be <b>finite</b>, as we said. Who would like to cook 
endlessly without eating any of that juicy meal, right? An infinite chain of
commands would not accumulate into a meaningful result. 
</p>

<div class="remark">
<p>
Computer programs and algorithms are different things. For practical reasons,
we might want to think some of our programs as running indefinitely. This
might be a web server waiting for requests in an infinite loop, as an
example. 
</p>

</div>

<p>
Secondly, and maybe more importantly, the notion of <b>model of computation</b>
is implicit in our understanding of algorithms. This gives us an agreed upon
set of basic instructions to describe our algorithms. I relied on, for example,
your knowledge of basic operations like addition, remainder etc. to describe
Euclid's Algorithm above. Cooks do not describe recipes by telling us which
muscles to move. They talk about things like cut the onion, put it into
sugar marmalade etc. They have their own language and operations. 
</p>

<p>
A model of computation is a theoretical model, an abstract computer that gives
us basic operations and their costs in terms of time and memory. There are
many different models like Turing machines, Lambda Calculus, Stack computers
and many more for different needs of theoretical computer scientists. You
can study them. In these notes, we will talk about real computers but I
should point out that the theoretical machine most similar to our real
digital computers is RAM model. Before going further, it is a good idea
to skim the Wikipedia page of Random Access Machines so that you can
get confused a little more.
</p>

<p>
Real computers we are going to talk about are huge systems. We said we
will talk about Intel64 but we should start small. Let's start with first
computers. In the beginning, computers were consisting of a CPU and a 
memory. They were communicating through a channel, a bus. See below figure.
</p>


<div id="orgc451301" class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/fig1-1.jpg" alt="fig1-1.jpg" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>A basic computer organization</p>
</div>

<p>
ALU part was carrying out the basic instructions like addition, less than
comparison etc. Conrol Unit was coordinating the CPU and memory. Of course,
some of the basic intsructions were related to control. For example, in
our algorithm, we had instructions like "go back to 1". These kind of tasks
also requires some basic instructions. Together, all those basic instructions
that can be performed by a CPU depicted its <b>instruction-set</b>. Memory is
just an array of bytes that we can index into random positions all we want.
</p>

<p>
Now comes the curicial idea that made whole this thing to be known what we
call today as <b>von Neumann architecture</b>, after great mathematician John
von Neumann. This is the idea of <b>stored program computer</b>. I will explain
it briefly. We saw that we represented data as binary numbers stored in our
memory. Can we also represent basic instructions as binary numbers? Sure we
can. Take the very crude example below.
</p>

<pre class="example">
1001 101110 010001 
add    46     33
</pre>

<p>
Imagine we have a computer that can perform 16 different basic instructions.
It can perform these on 6 bit numbers. Above 16 bits might represent addition
of 46 and 33. 1001 is called the <b>opcode</b> of the addition operation. Programs
are ordered set of instructions, executed one after the other. With this
binary representation program and data both became just numbers. Yes, everything
is a number. von Neumann suggested that since we can represent instructions
as numbers as well, we can just put our programs into memory, just like
our data. CPU can fetch an instruction, decode it and execute it. 
</p>


<div id="org76a4d75" class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/fig1-2.jpg" alt="fig1-2.jpg" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Stored Program Computer</p>
</div>

<div class="remark">
<p>
Notice immediately how we are faced with problem of overflows, sum of 46
and 33 is not a 6 bit number. How are you going to handle this situation?
We will see the method chosen by Intel but there are hundreads of design
decisions that go into crafting of a CPU. This is the field known as
<b>computer architecture</b> and it is a different engineering discipline. You
can be one but, as I said, it is different than programming. A programmer
does not need to know as much about computers as a computer architecture.
Nevertheless, she needs to know the fundamentals to use these devices
effectively. 
</p>

</div>

<p>
In a stored program computer, the basic operational principle of a computer
is known as <b>Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle</b>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Fetch the current instruction to be executed</li>
<li>Decode the operation and required operands</li>
<li>Execute the operation</li>
<li>Go back to 1</li>
</ol>
